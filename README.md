# Auto-search-and-download-Jisoo-image-on-twitter

My Master has ideas with twitter datas, 

so i think i need to do something funny first to get used to those API and data things.

Then i choose my Jisoo

I use tweepy and twint library mainly for this resporitory

Here is the preference that i have learned to make these code:

Tweepy:
